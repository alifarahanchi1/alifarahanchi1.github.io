I’m currently a Venture Fellow at Camford Capital where I work with an interdisciplinary team on several internal innovative initiatives related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the biomedical, clinical, and biological domains.

Prior to joining Camford Capital, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at The George Washington University (GWU) under the supervision of [Dr. Mona Diab](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mona-diab-55946614/) and [Dr. David Broniatowski](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/david-broniatowski). My main areas of research were AI and NLP, and my dissertation was on “Advancing Identification of Causal Relations in Natural Language”. I worked on several projects including building large language models with commonsense reasoning and causal relation understanding capabilities, and analytical frameworks for understanding how individuals make various decisions on social media, including the spread of disinformation and misinformation.
